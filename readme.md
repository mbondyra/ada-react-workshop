## THIS SHOULD BE EASY

1. Basing on working button `Alohomora`, make the other button work - you need to toggle position of candle and if it is fired or not. Go to a file `Candle/index.js` and check what props the candle expects. 

2. Come back to `Content/index.js` file and pass props as constants (e.g. fired=false, up=true). Check out all the cases. Flame is not firing? Are you sure you passed all the props down? ;)

3. Add extra states to Content Component and make buttons work! :)
