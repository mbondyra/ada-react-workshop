##1 get data from API

1. Check out `ComponentDidMount` method - the API call will execute after component will be created and mounted on the page.
2. It's time to install React Dev Tools extension in your browser - do it! :)
3. Check out the state of the <App/> Component.
4. Replace constants from the `render()` method with the values you'll calculate. Hint: use methods like `map`, `filter` or array property: `.length`
