# Ada React Workshop Create-react-app

## STEP 1: Instructions for running the environment

    1. Make sure you have those things installed by typing in your terminal:
        - node
        - yarn

    2. Install all the dependencies with: `yarn`

    3. Run your project with: `yarn start`

    4. You can view your project under `https://localhost:3000`. Any change you'll do will be automatically updated in the browser.

## STEP 2: Let's talk about the structure of the files

    1. That's a small break for explanation of Create-react-app boilerplate :)

## STEP 3: Get to know the project structure: Modify content, styles and JS

    1. Add your name in the main title `A letter to...`
    2. Based on imports in the file App.js guess which file contains csses. Play with the colors; change the color of the background of the object of class `App-bg` to see the hidden message.
    3. Once you reveal the hidden message, follow the instruction the message contains.

## STEP 4: Switch branch to go to the next exercise

    1. To display the updated instruction, go to the branch `1_and_3/4-the-letter-extracting-modules` in github. The instruction (coming from the readme file) will be updated.
    2. Checkout branch in your local repository (you can stash your changes before) `git checkout 1_and_3/4--the-letter-extracting-modules`
    3. The branch content is updated.
