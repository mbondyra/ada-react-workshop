## Get data from API

1. Check out `ComponentDidMount` method - the API call will execute after component will be created and mounted on the page.
2. It's time to install React Dev Tools extension in your browser - do it! :)
3. Now go to dev tools in Chrome (it's possible that you have to restart it first) and check out the state of the <App/> Component. Check out the structure of what you see - it's very useful for debugging. You can toggle state and see how the app is reacting. Cool!
4. Replace constants from the `render()` method with the values you'll calculate. 
  Hint 1 : use methods like `map`, `filter` or array property: `.length`
